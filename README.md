# Library System

### A simple library system consisting of a RESTful API (written in [Spring](https://spring.io/)) and an [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) client. 

#### Functionalities:
  - Viewing last books and magazines with their title, author(s), genre and rating [home page]
  - Creating a publication work - book or magazine [publication work create page]
  - Viewing full information for book/magazine [publication work details page]
  - Rating a book/magazine with restriction one time per IP (lame but better than none :smiley:) [publication work details page]
  - Viewing all publication works with filters for author and genre [all publication works page]

This project is made just to play with these frameworks. :)
